# Working with lists

## Lists

- are most general form of objects in R
- `[` accesses sub lists
- `[[` accesses elements
- for well-structured lists more powerful tools: `map` (`purrr`)

## Data accessibility

Part of a quantitative world is our responsibility to make data accessible

- Hans Rosling (2017✝) was at the fore-front of providing World Health Statistics (gapminder)
- in R through the package `gapminder` by Jenny Bryan
- Hans Rosling's [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen?language=en)


## First Look: US only

```{r}
library(gapminder)

gapminder %>% filter(country == "United States") %>% 
 ggplot(aes(x = year, y =lifeExp)) + geom_line() + geom_point()
```

How would you describe this plot?

## First Model: US only

```{r}
gapminder %>% filter(country == "United States") %>% 
 ggplot(aes(x = year, y =lifeExp)) + geom_line() + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE)
```

## Model of the US

```{r warning = FALSE}
lm(lifeExp~I(year-1950), data = filter(gapminder, country == "United States"))
```

## First Look: All countries

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
 ggplot(aes(x = year, y =lifeExp)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = country, colour=continent)) 
```

##Using models as exploratory tools

Now we would like to repeat this modelling approach to all countries, i.e. *split* by country, *apply* the model, *combine* the results. 

But we certainly don't want to subset the data for every country ... 

## Split-Apply-Combine for lists


- both summarize and mutate need vector objects as result, but model results are usually more complicated
- `nest` creates list of data frames (split)
- `map` applies function to list object (apply)
- `unnest` moves list results back into a data frame (combine)




## nest

- `nest` is a function in `tidyr`: creates variable `data`
- `data` is variable of data frames

```{r}
gapminder2 <- gapminder %>% mutate(year = year-1950)
countryList <- gapminder2 %>% nest(-country, -continent) 
countryList 
```

## Nested data frames

Each element of the ```data``` variable in ```countryList``` is a dataset:

```{r}
countryList$data[[10]] %>% arrange(year)
```

## Nested data frames (cont'd)

We can use the list elements as data inputs:

```{r}
lm(lifeExp~year, data=countryList$data[[10]])
```

<span style="color:white">The goal of this your turn is for you to try out nesting operations on various datasets.</span>

- <span style="color:white">Nest the `ChickWeight` data in different ways: what are the results of </span>

```
ChickWeight %>% nest(-Diet)
ChickWeight %>% nest(weight)
ChickWeight %>% nest(Time, weight)
```

- <span style="color:white">`chickwts` is yet another data set on feeding chicks. Nest it by different feeds. </span>
- <span style="color:white">`nest` respects grouping structure introduced by `group_by`. Use `group_by` to nest the `iris` dataset by species. </span>




##Fitting multiple models

Now we are using the ```map``` function in the package ```purrr```.

```map``` allows us to apply a function to each element of a list.

```{r}
myfit <- function (dframe) {
  lm(lifeExp ~ year, data = dframe)
}

countryList <- countryList %>% mutate(
    model = purrr::map(data, myfit)
)
head(countryList)
```


## Fitting multiple models - Alternative

`map` allows us to use a formula instead of a function (creates anonymous function on the fly):

```{r}
countryList <- countryList %>% mutate(
    model = purrr::map(data, ~ lm(lifeExp~year, data = .))
)
head(countryList)
```
## The broom package

Now we have all these models ... 

<img src="images/broom.jpeg" class="cover" width=1000>


## The ```broom``` package

```broom``` allows to extract values from models on three levels:

- for each model: ```broom::glance```
- for each coefficient in the model: ```broom::tidy```
- for each value in the dataset: ```broom::augment```

```{r}
library(broom)
broom::glance(countryList$model[[1]])
broom::tidy(countryList$model[[1]])
```

## 

```{r}
broom::augment(countryList$model[[1]])
```

##Extract values for each coefficient

Extract coefficients for all countries automatically (hello ```map``` again!)

```{r}
# works, but we lose the context
coefs = countryList$model %>% purrr::map(.f=broom::tidy)
head(coefs)
```

##Extract values for each coefficient (cont'd)

```{r}
# better, but everything is still stuffed into this strange format
countryList <- countryList %>% mutate(
  coefs = model %>% purrr::map(.f=broom::tidy)
) 
countryList %>% head()
```

## Ready to fly!

The opposite of `nest` is `unnest`:

```{r}
coefs <- countryList %>% select(country, continent, coefs) %>% 
  unnest()
coefs
```

## Reshaping

```{r fig.width=4.5, fig.height = 4.5}
coefsLong <- coefs %>% gather(key="Statistic", value = "Value", 4:7)
coefsTerm <- coefsLong %>% spread(key="term", value="Value")
coefsTerm %>% filter(Statistic == "estimate") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = `(Intercept)`, y = year)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = continent)) + ylab("Slope (year)")
```



## Your turn (10 mins)

- Extract other model diagnostics: find the R square value for each model. Draw a visualization of R square by country - can you see a pattern? What does the pattern mean?
- Extract residuals and fitted values for each of the models and store them in a dataset together with country and continent information. 
- Plot residuals across the years and fit a smooth. What does the pattern mean?
- Include predicted Life Expectancy for 2017 into the data set. Then compare predicted life expectancy in 2017 with that in 1950.
