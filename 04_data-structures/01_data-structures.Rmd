# Data Structures in R


## Outline

* standard types in R
* object classes 
* checking data quality

## Basic R objects

* Data types: numeric, integer, character, double
* Basic data structures: vector, matrix, character, factor, list

## Numeric values

Numeric objects have double precision, i.e. work with 53 bits 
```{r, echo=TRUE}
pi <- as.numeric(gsub(" ","","3.14159 26535 89793 23846 26433"))
# digits maximum is 22, last few digits are suspicious
print(pi, digits=22)
```

Precision is machine dependent:

```{r}
1 + .Machine$double.eps == 1
1 + .Machine$double.eps/2 == 1
```

***

```{r}
.Machine
```

## Characters

Character covers all text formats.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
x <- "Hello World"
class(x)
is.character(x)
```

We will be dealing with text in much more detail when we are looking at regular expressions ...


## Basic types in R

* **Vectors**: one-dimensional array of values of the same type; vectors have a length, but no dimension
* **Matrix**: two-dimensional array of values of the same type; matrices have a dimension given as (row, column), length returns the number of items (row x column)
* **Array**: any higher dimensional array (e.g. output of temperature data from netcdf data)

***

```{r}
x <- c("4.5", 3, TRUE, "elephant")
# The logical value becomes a character
x
# note that the cast from logical to 
# character doesn't survive intact
as.numeric(x) 

X <- matrix(c(1,2,3, 11,12,13), nrow = 2,
   ncol=3, byrow=TRUE, dimnames = 
   list(c("row1", "row2"), c("C.1", "C.2", "C.3")))
X
```

## Data frames

Data frame: collection of vectors of same length but possibly different types
```{r}
L3 <- LETTERS[1:3]
d <- data.frame(cbind(x=1, y=1:10), 
     fac=sample(L3, 10, replace=TRUE))
d %>% glimpse()
```

## Lists

* lists allow the most flexibility, i.e. are not very structured. 
* a list element can be anything, including another list
* very useful (and common) as output from analytic methods

```{r}
mod<-glm(mpg~cyl+disp+hp+drat+wt, data=mtcars)
head(str(mod))
```

## Working with lists

* single bracket operator [ ] returns sub-list

```{r}
mod[c(1,6,8)]
```

## Working with lists (cont'd)

* double bracket operator [[ ]] returns single list element (i.e. only single positive integer is allowed)
* similarly, named objects can be accessed using the `$` operator

```{r}
mod[[1]]
mod$rank
```

## Objects in R

* S3, S4 objects or reference class objects are used for more advanced and customized objects
* S3 objects are organized like a hybrid between regular data frames and lists
* the @ takes the role of $ in data frames

```{r message = FALSE, cache=TRUE}
library(maptools)
xx <- readShapeSpatial("../data/australia/region.shp")
class(xx)
slotNames(xx)
xx@bbox
```

##

* special functions can be implemented to deal with S3 objects. These are called __methods__

```{r}
methods(class=class(xx))
```

## Extract data for each spatial entity

```{r cache=TRUE}
as.data.frame(xx)
```

## Extract data for each spatial outline

```{r cache=TRUE}
map <- fortify(xx)
head(map)
```

## Plot the map

```{r cache=TRUE}
map %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) + geom_path()
```

## Your Turn (10 min)

- <span style="color:white">Download the shapefile for a country of your choice from [GADM - Boundaries without limits](http://www.gadm.org/country). (Make sure to select the shapefiles version of the boundary set) </span>
- <span style="color:white">Unzip the document and move the resulting folder into your working directory (or somewhere close to it).</span>
- <span style="color:white">Read the shapefile (there are usually shapefiles at different administrative levels - pick one), export the polygons and plot in `ggplot2`.</span>

## Your Turn - Solution

```{r}
shape <- maptools::readShapeSpatial("../data/DEU_adm_shp/DEU_adm1.shp")
head(as.data.frame(shape))
de1 <- fortify(shape)
```

## Your Turn - plot the map

```{r}
de1 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) + geom_path() +
  theme(aspect.ratio=1)
```
