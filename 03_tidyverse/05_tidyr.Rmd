# Dealing with Messy (3) and (4)

# Keys and Measurements

## Finding your keys - Example (1)

100 patients are randomly assigned to a treatment for heart attack, measured 5 different clinical outcomes.

## Finding your keys - Example (1)

100  patients are randomly assigned to a treatment for heart attack, measured 5 different clinical outcomes.

- key: patient ID
- factor variable (design): treatment
- measured variables: 5 clinical outcomes

## Finding your keys - Example (2)

Randomized complete block trial with four fields, four different types of fertilizer, over four years.  Recorded total corn yield, and fertilizer run off

## Finding your keys - Example (2)

Randomized complete block trial with four fields, four different types of fertilizer, over four years.  Recorded total corn yield, and fertilizer run off

- key: fields, types of fertilizer, year
- measurement: total corn yield, fertilizer run off


## Finding your keys - Example (3)

Cluster sample of twenty students in thirty different schools.  For each school, recorded distance from ice rink.  For each student, asked how often they go ice skating, and whether or not their parents like ice skating


## Finding your keys - Example (3)

Cluster sample of twenty students in thirty different schools.  For each school, recorded distance from ice rink.  For each student, asked how often they go ice skating, and whether or not their parents like ice skating

- key: student ID, school ID
- measurement: distance to rink, #times ice skating, parents' preference


## Finding your keys - Example (4)

For each person, recorded age, sex, height and target weight, and then at multiple times recorded their weight

## Finding your keys - Example (4)

For each person, recorded age, sex, height and target weight, and then at multiple times recorded their weight

- key: *patient ID*, date
- measurement: *age, sex, height, target weight*, current weight

*only patient ID is needed for variables in italics*

## Messy (3)

Messy (3): *Multiple observational units are stored in the same table.*

What does that mean? The *key is split*, i.e. for some values all key variables are necessary, while other values only need some key variables.

![](images/normal-not-2.png)

## Why do we need to take care of split keys?

- Data redundancy introduces potential problems (same student *should* have the same student ID)
- to check data consistency, we split data set into parts - this process is called *normalizing*
- normalization reduces overall data size
- useful way of thinking about objects under study


## Tidying Messy (3)

Splitting into separate datasets:

![](images/normal-split.png)

## Example: Box office gross

The-Numbers website publishes [weekly charts](http://www.the-numbers.com/weekend-box-office-chart) of the gross income of all movies playing across the US. A set of [scraped data](../data/boxoffice.csv) with movies for the last two years is available in the repo.

```{r echo = FALSE}
box <- read.csv("../data/boxoffice.csv")
head(box, 4)
```

What are the key variables? Why is the key split?

## First round of Data tidying

```{r}
box <- box %>% mutate(
  Gross = parse_number(Gross),
  Total.Gross = parse_number(Total.Gross),
  Days = parse_number(Days),
  Thtrs. = parse_number(Thtrs.)
) 
```

- All other variables are derived from these four variables, `Movie` name, `Rank`, `Date` and `Distributor`. 
- We should take re-calculate the derived variabes to check for consistency. 

## Taking care of the split key

```{r eval = FALSE}
# if we get an error with a message about the length of a dataset
# we know we have a problem
movie <- box %>% group_by(Movie) %>% summarize(
  Distributor = unique(Distributor) 
)
```

`Error: expecting a single value`

Bingo! but what now? 

```{r}
box %>% group_by(Movie) %>% summarize(
  Distributor = length(unique(Distributor))
) %>% arrange(desc(Distributor))
```

## Looking into inconsistencies

The movie *Girlhood* has two distributors: " "  and `Strand` - i.e. the first week the distributor is missing, let's fix that:

```{r}
box <- box %>% mutate(
  Distributor = replace(Distributor, Movie=="Girlhood", "Strand")
)
```

The movie `The Witness` is actually two different movies, one that came out in October 2015, another one that came out in June 2016. Movie name by itself is not a key. Let's derive the *release date* for each movie:

```{r}
box <- box %>% mutate(Release = lubridate::ymd(date)-Days)
```

## Splitting into separate datasets - Take 2

```{r}
movie <- box %>% group_by(Movie, Release) %>% summarize(
  Distributor = unique(Distributor) 
)
dim(movie)
length(unique(box$Movie))
```

Still not quite right - the number of days is a derived variable, and is not quite consistent. 

## 

```{r}
movie %>% group_by(Movie) %>% count() %>% arrange(desc(n)) %>% head(5)
movie %>% filter(Movie =="Hot Water")
```

## Different approach

```{r}
# introduce release date for each movie and distributor separately
box <- box %>% group_by(Movie, Distributor) %>% 
  mutate(
    Release = min(lubridate::ymd(date))-Days[which.min(lubridate::ymd(date))]
    )

# split again
movie <- box %>% group_by(Movie, Release) %>% summarize(
  Distributor = unique(Distributor) 
)
dim(movie)
length(unique(box$Movie)) # should be one less than above (b/c The Witness)
```

Better!

## Your Turn  (10 mins)


- Re-derive derived variables: `%Change`, `Rank last week`, `Days`, `Gross Per Theater`.<br>
- Is `Total.Gross` strictly increasing? And does `Gross` match with the differences from one week to the next?

How much of this can you do in 10 mins?

<img src="images/tools.jpeg" width=550>

## 


```{r}
# days and per theatre gross:
box <- box %>% ungroup() %>% mutate(
  Days_new = lubridate::ymd(date) - lubridate::ymd(Release),
  Per.Theater = Gross/Thtrs.
) 
box %>% select(Movie, Days, Days_new)
```

##

```{r}
# introduce change variable and rank-last-week:
box <- box %>% group_by(Movie, Release) %>% arrange(date) %>% mutate(
  Change = c(NA, diff(Gross)/Gross[-length(Gross)])*100,
  Rank.Last.Week_new = c(NA, Rank[-length(Rank)]),
  Days_diff = c(NA, diff(Days_new))
) 
# some of these ranks are not from last week:
box <- box %>% mutate(
  Rank.Last.Week_new = replace(Rank.Last.Week_new, Days_diff != 7, NA)
)

box %>% filter(Movie=="3 Hearts") %>% arrange(Days_new) %>% as.data.frame() %>% head(3)
```

##

```{r}
box <- box %>% group_by(Movie, Release) %>% 
  arrange(Days) %>% mutate(
    Gross_new = c(NA, diff(Total.Gross))
  )

box %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Gross, Gross_new, colour = Gross_new < 0)) + geom_point()

box %>% ungroup() %>%  filter(Gross_new <0) %>% select(Movie, date, Gross, Gross_new, Total.Gross) %>% arrange(Gross_new)
```

## 

Now we have finally a clean data set and could get started on an analysis!

Can you predict the Total Gross of a movie based on the opening weekend and the second week?

This is the dataset we used for lab #2.

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
movies <- box %>% select(date, Rank, Rank.Last.Week_new, Days_new, Movie, Distributor, Gross, Change, Total.Gross, Release, Thtrs., Per.Theater) 
names(movies) <- c("Date", "Rank", "Rank.Last.Week", "Days", "Movie", "Distributor", "Gross", "Change", "Total.Gross", "Release", "Theaters", "Per.Theater")
#write.csv(movies, file="../data/movies.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```


# Messy (4)

## Messy (4)

Messy (4): *Values for a single observational unit are stored across multiple tables.*

After data are normalized by splitting, we want to de-normalize again by *joining* datasets.

## Example: Lahman package

Sean Lahman is a database journalist, who started databases of historical sports statistics, in particular, the Lahman database on baseball.

```{r}
library(Lahman)
LahmanData
```

## Lahman database

The Lahman database consists of 24 data frames that are linked by `playerID`. <br>
This is clean, but not very readable. <br>
The `Master` table includes names and other attributes for each player. <br>
*Joining* multiple tables helps us to bring together (pieces of) information from multiple sources.

## Example: Hall of Fame

```{r warning = FALSE, fig.height = 3.5}
HallOfFame <- HallOfFame %>% group_by(playerID) %>% 
  mutate(times = order(yearID)) 

HallOfFame %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = yearID, y = votes/needed, colour = inducted)) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 1, colour = "grey20", size = .1) +
  geom_line(aes(group = playerID), colour = "black", size = 0.2) +
  geom_point() 
```

## Hall of Fame - how many attempts?

We'd like to label all the last attempts - and not just with the `playerID`
```{r warning = FALSE, fig.height = 3.5}
HallOfFame %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = times, y = votes/needed, colour = inducted)) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 1, colour = "grey20", size = .1) +
  geom_line(aes(group = playerID), colour = "black", size = 0.2) +
  geom_point() 
```


## Joins - general idea

![](images/join.png)

## Joins - more specific idea

- Data sets are joined along values of variables. 
- In `dplyr` there are various join functions: `left_join`, `inner_join`, `full_join`, ...
- Differences between join functions only visible, if not all values in one set have values in the other



##

```{r}
df1 <- data.frame(id = 1:6, trt = rep(c("A", "B", "C"), rep=c(2,1,3)), value = c(5,3,7,1,2,3))
df1
```

```{r}
df2 <- data.frame(id=c(4,4,5,5,7,7), stress=rep(c(0,1), 3), bpm = c(65, 125, 74, 136, 48, 110))
df2
```    

## Left join

- all elements in the *left* data set are kept
- non-matches are filled in by `NA`
- `right_join` works symmetric

```{r}
left_join(df1, df2, by="id")
```

## Inner join

- only matches from both data sets are kept

```{r}
inner_join(df1, df2, by = "id")
```


## Full join

- all ids are kept, missings are filled in with `NA`

```{r}
full_join(df1, df2, by = "id")
```

## Traps of joins

- sometimes we unexpectedly cannot match values: missing values, different spelling, ... 
- join can be along multiple variables, e.g. `by = c("ID", "Date")`
- joining variable(s) can have different names, e.g. `by = c("State" = "Name")`
- always make sure to check dimensions of data before and after a join
- check on missing values; help with that: `anti_join`


## Anti join

- a neat function in `dplyr`
- careful, not symmetric!  

```{r}
anti_join(df1, df2, by="id") # no values for id in df2
anti_join(df2, df1, by="id") # no values for id in df1
```

## Your turn (10 mins) {.white}

<img src="images/baseball.jpeg" width="1200" class="cover">

- <span style="color:white">Load the `Lahman` package into your R session.</span>
- <span style="color:white">Join (relevant pieces of) the `Master` data set and the `HallOfFame` data.</span>
- <span style="color:white">For the `ggplot2` chart label all last attempts of individuals with 15 or more attempts. Make sure to deal with missing values appropriately.</span>


## Solution

Not all organizations involved in inducting worthy candidates into the Hall of Fame take votes. <br>
We will take only voters into consideration:
```{r}
Voted <- HallOfFame %>% filter(!is.na(ballots)) %>% 
  group_by(playerID) %>% arrange(yearID) %>% 
  mutate( attempt = order(yearID))

dim(Voted)
Voted <- left_join(Voted, Master %>% select(playerID, nameFirst, nameLast), 
                   by = "playerID")
dim(Voted)
```

## Chart of induction

```{r warning = FALSE, fig.height = 3.5}
Voted %>% ggplot(aes(x = attempt, y = votes/needed)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 1, colour = "grey25", size = 0.1) +
  geom_line(aes(group = playerID), colour = "grey35", size = 0.2) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = inducted))
```

## Getting the dataset for the labels

```{r}
labels <- Voted %>% group_by(playerID) %>% summarize(
  votes = votes[which.max(attempt)],
  needed = needed[which.max(attempt)],
  attempt = max(attempt),
  name = paste(unique(nameFirst), unique(nameLast))
)
```

```{r warning = FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.height = 3.5}
Voted %>% ggplot(aes(x = attempt, y = votes/needed)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 1, colour = "grey25", size = 0.1) +
  geom_line(aes(group = playerID), colour = "grey25", size = 0.2) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = inducted)) +
  ggrepel::geom_label_repel(aes(label=name), data = labels %>% filter(attempt >=16))
```
