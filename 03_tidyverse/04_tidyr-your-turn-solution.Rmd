## Your Turn (5 min)

<img src="images/beardshear-view.png" width=1100 class="cover">

The Iowa Data Portal is a wealth of information on and about the State of Iowa. 

The website 
[Campaign Expenditures](https://data.iowa.gov/Government/Campaign-Expenditures/3adi-mht4/data) provides data on campaign expenditures. The code below reads the data into an R session.

```{r cache = TRUE, message = FALSE}
url <- "https://data.iowa.gov/api/views/3adi-mht4/rows.csv"
campaign <- readr::read_csv(url)
```

Assess the 'messiness' of the data. List issues that prevent us from working with the data directly. Which of these issues are of type (1) or (2) of messiness?

## Your Turn (10 min)

- Check the help for the function `parse_number` in the `readr` package and use it on the campaign expenditure data.
- Use `separate` to split the date variable into year, month and day.
- Use `separate` again to extract geographic latitude and longitude (Hint - you might need several steps of `separate`)
- Using `dplyr` functionality answer the following questions:

  1. What is the total amount of campaign expenditure?
  2. What is the single largest cost in the campaign expenditures?
  3. What time frame does the campaign expenditure cover?
  4. Plot geographic longitude and latitude. Do campaign expenditures stay in the State of IA? Investigate oddities.

## Bit of background ...

The first half of the Your-Turn is **what** we do to data, but the second half is **why**. 

Any new data set we get, we first have to *vet*: 

- find out about its background,
- get an idea of its quality by checking on (obvious) relationships,
- tidy into some normal form.

In the answer, we'll combine elements of the first and second half.

## Campaign expenditures

```{r warning=FALSE}
campaign <- campaign %>% mutate(
  expenditure = readr::parse_number(`Expenditure Amount`)
)  
summary(campaign$expenditure)

# total in millions of dollars:
sum(campaign$expenditure)/10^6 

# sort largest to smallest:
campaign %>% arrange(desc(expenditure)) %>% 
  select(Date, `Receiving Organization Name`, expenditure)
```

## Time frame

```{r}
campaign <- campaign %>% 
  separate(Date, into = c("Month", "Day", "Year"), 
           remove = FALSE)  %>% # keep the original column
  mutate( 
    Year = as.numeric(Year), 
    Month = as.numeric(Month),
    Day = as.numeric(Day)
  )
```

```{r}
campaign %>% count(Year)
```
## Geographic Locations

```{r warning = FALSE}
campaign %>% select(`City Coordinates`) %>% glimpse()

campaign <- campaign %>% 
  separate(`City Coordinates`, into = c("X", "coords"), sep="\n",  remove=FALSE) %>%
  separate(coords, into=c("whitespace", "lat", "long"), sep="[(),]") %>%
  select(-X, -whitespace) %>% # throw out variables
  mutate(
    long = parse_number(long),
    lat = parse_number(lat)
  ) 

campaign %>% select(long, lat)
```

## Money is leaving Iowa

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
iowa <- map_data("state") %>% filter(region == "iowa")
ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat), data = campaign) + 
  geom_path(data = iowa) +
  geom_point(aes(x = long, y = lat, colour = State == "IA"))
```

## Investigate oddities

there are points geographically outside the state with an Iowa address. 

```{r}
campaign <- campaign %>% mutate(
  inIA = sp::point.in.polygon(long, lat, iowa$long, iowa$lat)
)
campaign %>% filter(!inIA, State == "IA") %>% dim()
campaign %>% filter(!inIA, State == "IA") %>% select(`City Coordinates`)
```

##

There is no Chicago in Iowa - particularly not, with a ZIP code of 60654. 

387 records have a geographic location of (-93.92180955, 44.770556229). This is a location South West of Minneapolis, MN.

```{r}
campaign %>% filter(!inIA, State == "IA") %>% 
  count(long, lat) %>% arrange(desc(n))
```      

## 

... lots of these mis-located items have a date of the last day of the year:

```{r}
campaign %>% filter(!inIA, State == "IA", round(long,5)==-93.92181) %>%
  select(Date, `Committee Name`) %>% xtabs(data=., ~`Date`) %>% sort()
```
Does anybody have any ideas how to explain this? I'd love to hear from you!
