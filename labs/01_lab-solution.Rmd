# Lab #1 - Sample Solution

# Building a book

## Building a book - Problems that came up

- `xelatex` not installed or path not set
- particularly on Windows machines: system commands not working from R
- workaround: some people got the commands to work from the terminal window
- Inconsolata font not installed

# Weather stations

## US weather stations - Problems that came up

- Downloaded file is a zipped archive (`.tar.gz`) - how do we get to the files?
- workaround: on Windows you need to have 7-Zip installed
- alternative: use `untar` in R


## US weather stations

1. Download a copy of the monthly max temperature recordings from the USHCN website at https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ushcn/v2.5/
2. Unzip the archive and place the folder in your working directory.

*I am assuming that the downloaded tar.gz file is placed in a data folder one level above this file. Then we use `untar` to create a folder (which we rename to `ushcn` afterwards) in the data folder that contains all of the extracted files. Note that in the code chunk `cache` is set to `TRUE`. That means that as long we don't change the code, it will not be executed again.*

```{r cache = TRUE}
untar("../data/ushcn.tavg.latest.raw.tar.gz")
system("mv ../data/ushcn.v2.5.5.* ../data/ushcn")
```


## The function

- *For this function, we wrap the code from the slides on reading files into a function.*
- *Despite what the instructions say, I am using average temperature values and therefore call my function `tavg`.*
- *For the weather station I am using a default value (Fort Dodge) - that way the function works even if the user doesn't know any weather stations. What would be a convenient solution for the user?*
- *It would be good to check whether the file actually exists before trying to read it. We will talk about error handling more at a later point.*

## 

```{r}
tavg <- function(station="H00132999") {
  require(tidyverse)
  # get the right file name
  filename <- paste0("../data/ushcn/US",station,".raw.tavg")
  # read the file from fixed width format
  temps <- read_fwf(filename,
    col_positions = fwf_positions(
      start=c( 1,13, rep(16+9*0:11, each=4) + c(1,7,8,9)), 
      end  =c(11,16, rep(16+9*0:11, each=4) + c(6,7,8,9))))
  # name the variables
  names(temps) <- c("Station", "Year", 
    paste0(rep(c("Value","DMflag", "QCflag", "DSflag"), 12), 
           rep(1:12, each=4)))
  # get all the ValueXX variables into a variable called Temp
  # and make a Month variable from the column names
  temps <- temps %>% gather(key=Month, value = Temp, starts_with("Value")) %>%
    select(Station, Year, Month, Temp) %>%
    mutate(
      Temp = replace(Temp, Temp == -9999, NA), # -9999 are missing values
      Month = as.numeric(gsub("Value", "", Month)) # Months are now just numbers from 1 to 12
    )
  
  temps # return the long and skinny data
}
```




## Try the function out 


```{r message=FALSE}
storm <- tavg("H00137979") # weather station in Storm Lake, IA
head(storm)
```

## Visualize the data

*There's lots of ways to visualize the data - the time series is really long, so we need to pick the aspect ratio carefully to get an idea of the seasonal trends.*

```{r fig.width = 10, fig.height = 1}
library(ggplot2)

storm %>% ggplot(aes(x = Year+Month/12, y = Temp/100)) + geom_line()
```

## Extracting data for all weather stations

```{r}
stations <- library(tidyverse)
stations <- read_fwf("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stat585-at-ISU/materials/master/data/ushcn-v2.5-stations.txt",
  col_positions = fwf_positions(
    start=c(1,3, 13,22,33,39,42,73,80,87,94), 
    end  =c(2, 11,20,30,37,40,71,78,85,92,95)))
```

##

```{r}
names(stations) <- c("Country code", "Station ID",
                     "Latitude", "Longitude", "Elevation", "State",
                     "Name", "Comp1", "Comp2", "Comp3", "UTC offset")
stations$Elevation <- as.numeric(stations$Elevation)
# check that the formats are correct
stations %>% glimpse()
```

## 

The next command takes a moment (or five minutes), so we'll turn on caching again. The result is one big dataset of all monthly temperatures in the US between 1880 and now

We save it in a binary file and push it to the repo:
```{r message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
alldata <- stations$`Station ID` %>% purrr::map_df(tavg)
alldata <- na.omit(alldata)
dim(alldata)
saveRDS(alldata, "../data/temps.rds")
```

## US weather stations - main problem

File paths: local (or relative) and global (or absolute) file references

- What is the difference and why do we need to know?

## File structure is a tree

![](http://art.wallyzone.com/dm60a/tutorials/paths_files/pathstree_510x330.gif)

- a file is in a folder
- a folder consists of files and folders

## File structure notation

- `/` root directory, i.e. root of the tree at the top
- `~` short cut for user's home directory, usually something like `/Users/heike`
- `.` current directory
- `..` parent directory of the current directory 

## Global and local paths

Global file references start at the root and then navigate to the location, e.g.
`/www.server.com/dayclass/SmithMary/index.html`, `C:\\System\User\Myname\Files`,
`~/Desktop/Downloads`

Relative file references start from the current directory and navigate from there to the location, e.g.:
`index.html` is a file in the current directory (same as `./index.html`)
`../SmithMary/index.html` starts goes to the parent directory, then into folder`SmithMary`, i.e. starts from inside folder `SkyJohn`.

## Which paths should we use?

In RMarkdown files or your own websites:

- use local file paths whenever possible (faster and we can move or rename the parent folder)
- global file paths: for reference material and only if the file path exists openly (i.e. *never* use absolute references to files on your local machine/environment)
