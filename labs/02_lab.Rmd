## Movies of the last two years

The data set [movies](../data/movies.csv) consists of movies in theaters for the last two years. 

```{r}
movies <- read.csv("../data/movies.csv")
head(movies)
```

## Lab assignment

Using tools from `dplyr` and `ggplot2` answer the following questions:

- What were the most successful movies over the past two years? Make sure to define how you measure success. What can you say about movies that only came out recently?
- How long, on average, are movies in theaters? Also look at the median time. Try to figure out what contributes to the big difference.
- What is the standard trajectory of a movie's total gross? Draw a plot and label some of the trajectories. <br>
If you feel ambitious, you could try to model this trajectory - but if you do, make sure to detail all assumptions that you make.

## Deliverable 

Submit a write-up containing code, plot, and description in form of an RMarkdown file to Blackboard.
