## Movies of the last two years

The data set [movies](../data/movies.csv) consists of movies in theaters for the last two years. 

```{r}
movies <- read.csv("../data/movies.csv")
head(movies)
```

## Lab assignment

Using tools from `dplyr` and `ggplot2` answer the follwoing questions:

- What were the most successful movies over the past two years? Make sure to define how you measure success. What can you say about movies that only came out recently?
- How long, on average, are movies in theaters? Also look at the median time. Try to figure out what contributes to the big difference.
- What is the standard trajectory of a movie's total gross? Draw a plot and label some of the trajectories. <br>
If you feel ambitious, you could try to model this trajectory - but if you do, make sure to detail all assumptions that you make.

Deliverable: Submit a write-up containing code, plot, and description in form of an RMarkdown file to Blackboard. 

## Most successful movies

Measure of success: Total gross - which means that recently released movies are biased against because they just didn't have enough time yet to accumulate a lot of total gross. 

```{r}
movies %>% group_by(Movie, Release) %>% summarize(
  final = max(Total.Gross),
  date = Date[which.max(Total.Gross)]
) %>% arrange(desc(final))
```

## Most successful movies (cont'd)

We could also use boxoffice gross over the opening weekend to measure success. This gives a slightly different set of most successful movies - maybe the ones with the most promise or the most loyal fans:

```{r}
movies %>% filter (Days <=5) %>% group_by(Movie, Release) %>% summarize(
  gross = sum(Gross, na.rm=TRUE),
  date = Date[1]
) %>% arrange(desc(gross))
```
## Time in theaters

There are some movies with a really, really long time in theaters. Those are movies that are shown again and again in theaters (but most of them not at all times).

```{r}
# first we exclude all of the movies that are currently in theaters:
times <- movies %>% group_by(Movie, Release) %>% summarize(
  intheaters = max(Days),
  lastday = Date[which.max(Days)]
) %>% filter(lastday != "2017-01-27") 


times %>% ungroup() %>% summarize(mean(intheaters), median(intheaters))

times %>% arrange(desc(intheaters))
```


## Trajectory of total gross

```{r fig.height=3.5}
movies %>% filter(Days < 100) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Days, y = Total.Gross))  + 
  geom_line(aes(group = interaction(Movie, Release)), alpha = 0.5) +   
  xlim(c(0,110)) +
  geom_text(aes(x = Days+7, label=Movie), 
            hjust = 1,
            data = movies %>% filter(Total.Gross > 2.5*10^8, Days < 100) %>% 
              group_by(Movie) %>% filter(Days == max(Days))) 
```

## Problems along the way

- do not use absolute file paths (see discussion of the [last lab](01_lab-solution.html) for more details on file paths)
- stick to the questions:
    - use `dplyr` and `ggplot2` to answer *all* the questions: the questions all had some solution using `dplyr` functionality - so look a bit closer in case you don't see the solution right away, because that was a bit of the point for this lab: recognizing situations where we can successfully apply new functionality rather than using what we always use.
    - find successful movies, not just top movie
    - directly label trajectories with names of movies: work with layers in ggplot!
