# Lab #6: it's shiny!



## Lab Assignment

The objective of today's lab is to create a shiny web-app.

There are no restrictions in terms of the topic.

**Minimum specs for your app:** use a data set, have at least three (meaningful) widgets, and at least one chart. 
**At least one of the widgets is supposed to be implemented from the chart (i.e. you'll need to use ggvis, plotly or d3scatter)**

## Deliverable 

Submit your file `app.R` and all of the data needed  to Blackboard.
