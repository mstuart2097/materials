# Lab #5: The making of an R package

## R packages

```{r}
nrow(available.packages(contriburl = 
                          contrib.url("https://cran.rstudio.com/", 
                                      type = "both")))

## Getting ready

DESCRIPTION: dependencies!!!
Install git on the machine you want to use for the lab
Make sure that it works with RStudio - XXX example code to test that everything works?

## Lab Assignment

The objective of today's lab is to create and R package, document it and make it available through a github repository.

1. Create an R package with at least one (exported) function and one dataset. 
2. Document both the function and the dataset appropriately. 
3. Place your R package on github, such that it is possible to install via the `install_github` function in the `devtools` package (e.g. try `install_github("heike/ggmapr")`).
4. Write a `README.md` file to showcase your package.
5. Make sure that your package passes CRAN check, i.e. run `devtools::check()` without any warnings or errors.

## Deliverable 

Submit the link to your github repository and paste the results from `devtools::check()` to Blackboard.
