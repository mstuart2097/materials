# R packages: Data and Dependencies

## Data in a package

- Data frames must be stored in the `data` folder using the command `save`
- Two *very* important notes:
    - file must have the extension `.rda` (all lower case)
    - `save` stores object *together with its name*, to avoid complications use the same name for the object and its file name
    
```
# read data into work session:
obj <- read.csv("some data from some source")
save(obj, file="obj.rda")
```

## Documenting Data

- Data documentation: http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/data.html#documenting-data

```
#' Prices of 50,000 round cut diamonds.
#'
#' A dataset containing the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000
#' diamonds.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 53940 rows and 10 variables:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{price}{price, in US dollars}
#'   \item{carat}{weight of the diamond, in carats}
#'   ...
#' }

## DESCRIPTION

another important aspect of the DESCRIPTION file: declaring dependencies, i.e. other packages that are needed for running yours:

```
Package: happyR
Type: Package
Title: What the Package Does (Title Case)
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Who wrote it
Maintainer: The package maintainer <yourself@somewhere.net>
Description: More about what it does (maybe more than one line)
    Use four spaces when indenting paragraphs within the Description.
License: What license is it under?
Depends: 
    ggplot2 (>= 2.2.1),
    dplyr (>= 0.4.0.1)
Encoding: UTF-8
LazyData: true
```

## Depends, Suggests or Imports?

DESCRIPTION file has three tags to declare relationships with other packages:

- `Depends:` or `Imports:` make sure the package is installed when installing your package. `Imports` loads the package, `Depends` only attaches the package. Any packages listed in `Imports` are needed for your package to work. 
- `Suggests:` your package can use these packages, but doesnâ€™t require them.

## Where to go further?

Read through other people's packages!

Dare to read!

All packages have the same structure - if you want to do something and can't get it to work, have a look at someone else's solution and try to adapt it to your situation
